                                    My journey in the beauty industry has been guided by passion,
                                    perseverance, and a deep belief in standing confidently in my own
                                    identity guided by values instilled in me early on.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Before creating a brand of my own, I spent several formative years
                                    learning from within the professional salon space—building a strong
                                    foundation in discipline, service standards, and the responsibility
                                    that comes with earning a client's trust. These experiences shaped
                                    my respect for consistency and the intimate role beauty plays in confidence.
                                </p>

                                        <motion.div

                                                As my perspective evolved, I later associated with a Hyderabad-based
                                                salon brand, contributing to its growth alongside trusted collaborators.
                                                This phase refined my understanding of leadership and scale, and clarified
                                                what mattered most to me: integrity, refinement, and thoughtfully crafted
                                                experiences over volume.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                With the encouragement of friends, family, and loyal clients, that shared
                                                trust gave shape to Christalin Mirrors—a brand built on experience,
                                                intention, and care.

                                            <p>
                                                Christalin Mirrors is more than a salon; it is a reflection of skill,
                                                empowerment, and quiet confidence—guided by thoughtful growth and an
                                                unwavering commitment to excellence.
